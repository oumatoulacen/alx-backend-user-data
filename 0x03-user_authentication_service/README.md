# User Authentication Service

This project provides a user authentication service with CRUD operations using a database. It consists of several modules that work together to create a secure and efficient API.

## Modules

### db.py

The `db.py` module handles the database operations and provides an interface for performing CRUD operations. It ensures the integrity and security of the data stored in the database.

### auth.py

The `auth.py` module is responsible for authenticating the CRUD operations performed by users. It implements various authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data.

### user.py

The `user.py` module defines the user model, which represents the structure and behavior of a user in the system. It includes attributes such as username, password, email, etc., and provides methods for managing user-related operations.

### app.py

The `app.py` module serves as the entry point for the Flask application. It sets up the API routes, initializes the necessary components, and handles incoming requests. It acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend, providing a seamless user experience.

### main.py

The `main.py` module contains integration tests for the application. It ensures that all the components of the system work together correctly and that the API endpoints behave as expected. These tests help maintain the reliability and stability of the application.
